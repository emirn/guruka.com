Our games at GURUKA are based on decades of cognitive psychology research. Here's what the science actually says about brain training and how to get the most out of your practice.

## Evidence-Based Approach

GURUKA's games are designed based on well-established cognitive training paradigms from neuroscience research. Each game targets specific cognitive functions that have been shown to be trainable under controlled conditions.

While the field of cognitive training continues to evolve, we've selected tasks with the strongest evidence for producing measurable improvements in trained abilities.

## Research Behind Each Game

### Speed Match: Processing Speed Training

Based on the n-back paradigm, one of the most researched cognitive training tasks.

**Key Research:**

- **Jaeggi et al. (2008)** found that n-back training can improve fluid intelligence, with benefits transferring to novel tasks. [DOI: 10.1073/pnas.0801268105](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0801268105)

- **Au et al. (2015)** meta-analysis showed consistent improvements in working memory from n-back training. [DOI: 10.1037/xge0000009](https://doi.org/10.1037/xge0000009)

### Memory Matrix: Spatial Working Memory

Targets the visuospatial sketchpad component of working memory.

**Key Research:**

- **Klingberg et al. (2002)** demonstrated that spatial working memory training leads to improvements in non-trained tasks. [DOI: 10.1016/S0022-0965(02)00093-7](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0022-0965(02)00093-7)

- **Holmes et al. (2009)** showed lasting improvements in working memory following adaptive spatial training. [DOI: 10.1111/j.1469-7610.2009.02093.x](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-7610.2009.02093.x)

### Sequence Recall: Dual-Task Training

Combines multiple cognitive demands to train executive function.

**Key Research:**

- **Dahlin et al. (2008)** updating training showed transfer effects to working memory tasks. [DOI: 10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02204.x](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02204.x)

- **Karbach & Kray (2009)** task-switching training showed broad cognitive benefits across age groups. [DOI: 10.1037/a0015012](https://doi.org/10.1037/a0015012)

## Important Caveats

We believe in being transparent about what brain training can and cannot do:

- Individual results vary significantly based on baseline abilities and engagement
- Transfer to real-world tasks is still debated in the scientific community
- Consistency and effort matter more than total time spent
- Brain training should complement, not replace, physical exercise, sleep, and social engagement
- Claims of preventing dementia or significantly increasing IQ are not well-supported

## Training Recommendations

Based on the research, here are our recommendations for effective brain training:

1. **Train regularly** - 15-20 minutes daily is more effective than occasional long sessions

2. **Vary your games** - Rotate between all three games to train different cognitive skills

3. **Challenge yourself** - Push to higher levels where you make mistakes - that's where learning happens

4. **Stay consistent** - Build a streak and make training a habit for best results

5. **Get enough sleep** - Sleep is crucial for memory consolidation and cognitive function
